I hired interior designers to help with elements within my (at the time) new apartment. With black and golden yellows featured throughout, the designers picked this out as a possibility for the dining room. It worked for the short term but I eventually moved The Honeymoonerâ€™s Bed piece into the dining room, which fits better in that space.

Five on a Wire was one of the first large pieces of artwork I purchased, added to my dining room and paired with a light fixture 
that had five red lights on it. ("There are four lights!") I've always enjoyed the pairing of these two elements in the space. 

The artist is from Etobicoke, Ontario, which is nice to support localish artists.

I was reading Reddit and saw an interesting piece of artwork in a photo of some interior design work. It caught my attention and I proceeded to research to find the artist. Turns out, he’s a well established artist who focusses heavily on folded paper artwork. He’s even been on Sesame Street. 

I found a piece that worked with the black and gold aesthetic of my apartment and is a joy to look at every time I pass it.

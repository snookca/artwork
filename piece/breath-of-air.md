I was looking for a piece of artwork to go in the entryway of my apartment. Having a lot of warm orange yellows in the space at the time, I wanted another accent colour and quickly settled on green. This piece felt just right, with its autumn landscape feel. Its abstract style created the warm ambiance I wanted when people first enter into my home.

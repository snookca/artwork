The story behind this piece is a somewhat amusing one. I was in Wellington with my then-girlfriend, Kitt Hodsden, and we saw this piece in a gallery. We both liked the piece but she especially did. 

Some years later, I looked into whether the piece was still available. It was not but I was told that I could commission a similar painting (for a similar price as the original) and so I did. The commissioned piece, while indeed similar, didn’t replicate the original, and as it turned out, I was incorrect in how much she liked the original piece. A swing and a miss. 

While it’s heavy on the reds, I’ve come to really enjoy the piece for its lush textures and find it really works well in the space it’s in now, where I’ve received a number of compliments on it.

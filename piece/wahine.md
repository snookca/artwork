On my first trip to New Zealand, I came across the artworks of Lester Hall while perusing a Wellington gallery. I didnâ€™t know anything about New Zealand, the artist, or the meaning behind them, but I did like the pieces. Hall combines various elements of Kiwi culture, which some have more recently called him out for appropriating Maori culture in his works. As a result of this criticism, much of his work is no longer available for sale.

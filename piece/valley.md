I hired interior designers to help with elements within my (at the time) new apartment. With black and golden yellows featured throughout, the designers picked this out as a possibility. They’re large and fill the space well but I don’t have a strong emotional attachment to them and will likely be replaced eventually by something that speaks to me. 

While the pair is referred to as Valley and Shadow, I didn’t know the name or what it represented until I looked it up to document here. I referred to them as eggs up until someone on a conference call referred to them as boobs and they’ve been the boobs ever since.

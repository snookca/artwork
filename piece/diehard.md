I’m a big fan of Die Hard, having seen the move countless times as a teenager working at a movie theatre. It’s become a yearly watch at Christmas for me. When I saw this poster become available for sale, I had to get it. Unfortunately, I missed the original sale and ended up buying it off eBay afterwards. I like the Japanese styling and the barrel of the gun turning into the tower.
